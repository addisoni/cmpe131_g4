## Ethical Implications
While building an application may simply look like we’re just writing code from the client’s point of view, it also involves several different responsibilities to create a smooth and safe experience for them. 
Ethically, and also professionally, we as developers should always ensure that all data collected from the end-user is used responsibly, transparently, and is safely secured from outside and inside attacks. 
In designing these applications, we should also focus on user empowerment and accessibility so they are able to control their experience to fit their needs and won’t feel squandered or limited with their 
abilities to use the software like other users.

Engineering solutions have a huge influence on our daily lives from a global, economical, environmental, and societal point of view. 
On a global scale, it promotes communication and collaboration between different parts of the world and through things such as the internet which allows us to connect online instead of needing to be
there in person, we’re able to share our knowledge with one another which promotes growth. Economically, engineering solutions push for economic growth, development, and stability in which we are
constantly improving and expanding our technological capabilities. Without this driving force, we would be stuck at a standstill in developing a more idealistic world in which we continue to grow and
prosper. Environmentally, engineering solutions play a huge role in addressing challenges such as climate change, global warming, or even resource depletion. As the world continues to grow, so does our
need for more resources but in turn we need to understand how important it is to develop more green solutions to mitigate these negative effects. Finally, in a societal context, these engineering solutions
have made an impact on things such as housing needs (purified/clean water, electricity, and shelter), our healthcare system in creating equipment and devices to care for various types of patients, and our
education system where we learn and build upon these solutions we discover and manifest.

Overall, engineering solutions are an impactful and important part of our lives and we will continue to need them as our world evolves and challenges become more diversified.
